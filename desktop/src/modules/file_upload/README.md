# File Upload Module

## Architecture

The `file_upload` module is responsible for handling the user interface and logic related to uploading files to the RAG service. It integrates with the `api_client` module to send the files and provides feedback to the user on the upload status. This module primarily deals with the Electron renderer process, specifically the UI elements that trigger file selection and display upload progress/results.

## How It Works

The `file_upload.js` file will contain functions that:

1.  **`initFileUpload(uploadButtonSelector, fileInputSelector, statusDisplaySelector)`:**
    * **Purpose:** Initializes event listeners for the file upload elements.
    * **Mechanism:** Attaches an `onclick` listener to the upload button and an `onchange` listener to a hidden file input element. When the button is clicked, it programmatically triggers the file input. When a file is selected, it calls `handleFileSelection`.

2.  **`handleFileSelection(event)`:**
    * **Purpose:** Processes the selected file and initiates the upload.
    * **Mechanism:** Extracts the `File` object from the event, displays a "Uploading..." status, calls the `api_client.uploadFile()` function, and then updates the UI with success or error messages. It also sends a message to the active chat session indicating the upload status.

3.  **UI Feedback:**
    * The module will manage the display of status messages (e.g., "Uploading file...", "Upload successful!", "Upload failed: ...") to inform the user about the progress and outcome of the upload operation.
    * It will integrate with the `chat_manager` to add specific "upload status" messages to the current chat's history, making the file upload part of the conversational flow.
